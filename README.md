# Clinic Management System

# Project Overview
The Clinic Management System is a user-friendly desktop application designed to streamline the management of patient records and appointments in a clinic. This system includes two main interfaces—one for the Admin and one for the User—each tailored to meet the needs of clinic administrators and patients.

The system allows the Admin to efficiently manage patient data, book and cancel appointments, and modify records as necessary, while the User interface enables easy access to view personal patient records and today's reservations.

# Features

  2-Modify Patient Record: Edit existing patient records to keep them up-to-date.
  3-Book Appointment: Schedule appointments with doctors for patients and assign specific time slots.
  4-Cancel Appointment: Allows admins to cancel patient appointments if necessary.

# User Interface:
